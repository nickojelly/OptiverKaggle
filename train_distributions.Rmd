## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
train <- read.csv("~/GitHub/OptiverKaggle/train.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r fig1, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 20}
train$date_factor = as.factor(train$date_id)
train = as_tibble(train)
train_last_min = train %>% filter(seconds_in_bucket>480)
p <- ggplot(train_last_min, aes(x=target, color=date_factor)) +
  geom_density()+
  xlim(-50,50)+
  theme(legend.position="none")
p

```
